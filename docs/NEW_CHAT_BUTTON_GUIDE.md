# 🔘 "New Chat" Button - How It Works

## What is the "New Chat" Button?

The **"+ New Chat"** button in the top right corner is designed to **reset your conversation** and start fresh.

---

## 🎯 **Purpose:**

This button allows you to:
- ✅ **Start a brand new conversation** with MellissAI
- ✅ **Clear all previous messages** from the current chat
- ✅ **Get a fresh conversation ID** (for tracking purposes)
- ✅ **Return to the welcome screen** with suggestion cards

---

## 📖 **How to Use It:**

### Step 1: Have a Conversation First
1. Type a message in the chat box
2. Send it to MellissAI
3. Get responses and have a conversation

### Step 2: Click "New Chat"
1. Click the **"+ New Chat"** button in the top right
2. Your chat history will be cleared
3. You'll see the welcome screen again
4. You can start a completely fresh conversation

---

## ❓ **Why It Seems Like It's Not Working**

If you're on the **welcome screen** (like in your screenshot), the button won't appear to do anything because:

- ❌ There's no chat history to clear yet
- ❌ You're already on the welcome screen
- ❌ Nothing visually changes

**This is normal!** The button only has a visible effect **after** you've sent messages.

---

## ✅ **Test to Confirm It Works:**

### Try this:

1. **Type a message:** "What is go-to-market strategy?"
2. **Click Send** ➤
3. **Wait for AI response**
4. **Type another message**
5. **Get another response**
6. **Now click "+ New Chat"** button

**Expected Result:**
- ✨ All messages disappear
- ✨ Welcome screen appears
- ✨ Fresh conversation starts

---

## 🔧 **Technical Details:**

When you click "New Chat", the code does this:

\`\`\`javascript
function startNewChat() {
    conversationId = generateConversationId();  // New ID
    messagesContainer.innerHTML = '';           // Clear messages
    welcomeScreen.style.display = 'flex';       // Show welcome
    chatContainer.style.display = 'none';       // Hide chat
    messageInput.value = '';                    // Clear input
    messageInput.focus();                       // Focus input
}
\`\`\`

---

## 💡 **Use Cases:**

You might want to use "New Chat" when:

1. **Starting a new topic** - Keep different discussions separate
2. **Clearing sensitive info** - Remove previous conversation from screen
3. **Testing different prompts** - Start fresh without context from previous messages
4. **Conversation gets too long** - Reset and start clean

---

## 🐛 **Is It Actually Broken?**

Based on your screenshots and the code, the button **IS working correctly**!

### Why you think it's not working:
- You're testing it on the welcome screen (where there's nothing to reset)
- No visible change happens because you haven't sent any messages yet

### To verify it works:
1. Send at least 2-3 messages
2. Have a conversation visible on screen
3. **Then** click "New Chat"
4. You'll see everything reset and welcome screen returns

---

## ✅ **Summary:**

| **Scenario** | **What Happens** |
|--------------|------------------|
| On welcome screen | Button does nothing visible (already in reset state) |
| After chatting | Button clears chat and returns to welcome screen |
| During chat | Button resets everything and starts fresh |

**The button is working!** It's just designed to be used **after** you've had a conversation, not before.

Would you like me to add any additional features to the "New Chat" button, such as:
- ✨ A confirmation dialog ("Are you sure you want to clear this chat?")
- ✨ A toast notification ("Chat cleared! Starting fresh...")
- ✨ Save conversation history before clearing

Let me know!
